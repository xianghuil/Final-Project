# Final-Project
# Basic Description
My final project is about breast cancer in Korea, and I collect the data from the website and gather the data I want.
In my data, all the samples are from young women and they are donors. I want to compare the survival state of the patients whose relapsed type are distant recurrence/metastasis, which can present the survival rate of this relapsed type patients. Thus, in my file, you can see the these data there. 
# Milestone 1 11.13
I'm not sure my data is enough, and in the next seven days, I will move foward to collect data and try to study the raw data of patients' gene if they have some impact in patients' relapsed. Also, I'm thinking about the gene expression also can impact the relapsed rate. Thus, I'm also thinking about use which function and method could to reflect this issue clearly. I will try to use heat map that can reflect the replased rate in the data.
